For estimating the impact of gun control laws on suicide rates

This is a quick analysis to support my substack post ["Maybe it's the firearms that lead to more death by suicide in some states?"](https://davidmanuel.substack.com/p/6fb3b0e1-e8f4-4aef-a6bc-d8c69b786659).

The data on suicide deaths is from https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D392F539 and gun control is operationalized as a binary category variable (for simplicity) based on [this](https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/law/secure-storage-or-child-access-prevention-required/) figure from Every Town.
